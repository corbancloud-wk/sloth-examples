# sloth-examples

Exists just to keep a reference handy of the I/O of SLOth

Running the sloth binary with the `generate` command creates a local equivalent
to the same Sloth->Prometheus CR transpilation that happens on a k8s cluster
When the SLOth operator is installed and a SLOth SLO CR is applied

`./sloth generate --input input.yaml --out output.yaml`
